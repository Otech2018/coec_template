                                Around 61 million primary school–age children remained out of school in 2014—a third of them in India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Sudan, many from poor households. In Nigeria 71 percent of children from poor households were not attending school in 2013, compared with only 5 percent of children from rich households. There is also inequity in education between children from rural and urban areas in many countries: those from urban areas are almost three times more likely than children from rural areas to complete nine years of schooling... And girls are disadvantaged in either case. Girls from poor households are less likely than boys from poor households to complete nine years of schooling; and the trend is similar for girls from rural households.
